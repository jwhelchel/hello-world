Hello Humans of github.
Been away from the codeverse for a while trying to hone my skills as a writer.  Writing code is another way to be creative though.  And I findmyself free to not try and keep up with all that is changing anymore.  Just have fun building something.  I like the idea of being able to point someone to my code to show them what I've been building.
